                          PREDICTION OF HOUSE PRICES USING NEURAL NETWORK
The basken housing Preidiction dataset is wellknown dataset in a Machine Learning often use to regression model.

GOAL: 
The Goal of the case study is to Predict the value of owner occupied home based on various feature 
DATA SET :

The Boston Housing Dataset is a derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston MA. The following describes the dataset columns:

CRIM - per capita crime rate by town
ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town
B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
LSTAT - % lower status of the population
MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's



OBJECTIVE:
* the objective is to create a regression model that predicts the home value based certain features .
* Neural networks will aoiled to model these relationship , ultilizing there ability to capture the complex pattwerns and interactions within the dataset.

DATA PRE-PROCESSING:
* Handling missing data .
* Feature Scaleing means doing ina way that 
* train test split  -  diving the dataset in training and testing .
                       70% Training 30% TESTING or 80% Training 20% Testing .
                        K-FOLD CROSS VALIDATION.
